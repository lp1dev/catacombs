            <p>You are lost in the catacombs, your flashlight just died and you don't have any other light source around you.</p><br/>
            <p>Your goal is to successfully get out without dying. You have 3 lives which will be used if you walk on glass or are bitten by rats.</p><br/>
            <p>Each map is randomly generated and have at least one exit</p><br/>
            <p><b>Important: </b> This game is supposed to be played with a headset, sounds enabled, a pen, a paper and <b>without using the minimap</b> which is only here if you want to see what the map looks like after playing it.</b></p>
